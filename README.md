# About SafeNet

- ## What is SafeNet?

We believe in the concept that the feeling of Humanity and a part of Humans is all about helping others in
need. What's more important than being safe
and not having to worry about who will be
there for you when you are in trouble.

SafeNet is a project which attempts to do just
that. SafeNet focuses on public safety which
depends on creating a community of safety

volunteers and using this community to
provide instant assistance to anyone in need
of help.

- ## What are the features that SafeNet offers?


SafeNet's basic user interface is an app
where in any citizen can sign up
as volunteers and they will be verified and on
boarded to our community. 
The App Users can use the app to get help when in danger or feels threatened . The App creates
alerts for the nearby Volunteers, the Police and Loved ones of the user. So the nearby volunteers can reach there on time
and help the person in trouble.
Building a community of people, who are willing to help
others in need, is the main goal of this
project. We also will also have continuous monitoring of the streets via CCTV and, other Outdoor Surviellance Systems and process these live feeds using our 3D RestNet and LSTM to do anomaly detection on these live streams.

Let's help each other and be safe.
