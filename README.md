# About SafeNet

- ## What is SafeNet?
We believe in the concept that a part of human is all about helping others in
need. What's more important than being safe
and not having to worry about who will be
there for you when you are in trouble.

SafeNet is a project which attempts to do just
that. SafeNet focuses on public safety which
depends on creating a community of safety
volunteers and using the this community to
provide instant assistance to anyone in need
of help.

- ## What are the features that SafeNet offers?

SafeNet's basic user interface is an app which
where in any citizen  can sign up
as volunteers and they will be verified and on
boarded to our community. 
The users of the app when in danger or feels threatened can use the app to get help. The
alerts the nearby volunteers and also the
police and loved ones of the user. In this way
the nearby volunteers can reach there on time
and help the person in trouble.
Building this community of people who are willing to help
others in need is the main goal of this
project.We also will also have continuous CCTV monitoring if the streets and process this live feeds using our 3d RestNet and LSTM to do anomaly detection on these live streams.

Lets help each other and be safe.
