**********UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset******************************************

**********************************************************************************

*The folders Peds1 and Peds2 contain the individual frames of each clip in TIFF format.

*Peds1 contains 34 training video samples and 36 testing video samples. 

*Peds2 contains 16 training video samples and 12 testing video samples. All testing samples are associated with a manually-collected frame-level abnormal events annotation ground truth list (in the .m file).
   
*The training clips in both sets contain ONLY NORMAL FRAMES. 

*Each of the testing clips contain AT LEAST SOME ANOMALOUS FRAMES. 
A frame-level annotation of abnormal events is provided in the ground truth list under the test folder (in the form of a MATLAB .m file). The field 'gt_frame' indicates frames that contain abnormal events.

*10 test clips from the Peds1 set and 12 from Ped2 are also provided with PIXEL LEVEL GROUNDTRUTH MASKS.
These masks are labeled "Test004_gt", "Test014_gt", "Test018_gt" etc. in the Peds1 folder. 
(There is also full pixel level annotation on Ped1 for all 36 testing videos available at http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/COMPVIS/research/abnormality)
