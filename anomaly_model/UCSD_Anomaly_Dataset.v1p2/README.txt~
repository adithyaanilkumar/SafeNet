*The folders Peds1 and Peds2 contain the individual frames of each clip in TIFF format. The frame rate of all clips is 10fps.

*Peds1 contains 34 training video samples and 36 testing video samples. 

*Peds2 contains 16 training video samples and 12 testing video samples. All testing samples are associated with a manually-collected frame-level abnormal events annotation ground truth list (in the .m file).
   
*The training clips in both sets contain ONLY NORMAL FRAMES. 

*All testing samples contain ATLEAST SOME ANOMALOUS FRAMES. 
A frame-level annotation of abnormal events is provided in the ground truth list under the test folder (in the form of a MATLAB .m file). The field 'gt_frame' indicates frames that contain abnormal events.


*10 test clips from the Peds1 set and 9 from Ped2 are also provided with PIXEL LEVEL GROUNDTRUTH MASKS (1 indicates anomalous region and 0 otherwise).
These masks are labeled "Test004_gt", "Test014_gt", "Test018_gt" etc. in the Peds1 folder.
