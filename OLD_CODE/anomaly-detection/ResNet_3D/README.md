# 3D Resnet Implementation.

This is a totally stripped down 3D-Resnet from the original implementation by @kenshohara [here.](https://github.com/kenshohara/3D-ResNets-PyTorch) This folder is meant to act as only a module to support the 3D-Resnet functionalities of the project. For detailed implementation and running of the 3D-Resnet PyTorch implementation, please refer the original repository.
